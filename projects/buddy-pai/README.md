# Buddy PAI - Personal AI Infrastructure

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Phase_2_Implementation-blue?style=flat-square) ![Priority](https://img.shields.io/badge/Priority-Critical-red?style=flat-square)

**Transformation**: Buddy AI Assistant → Distributed Intelligence Network  
**Inspired by**: Daniel Miessler's PAI Philosophy  
**Goal**: 90% reduction in manual tasks, 10x faster decisions

## The Big Idea

Stop being a **tool operator**. Become an **infrastructure commander**.

Traditional AI makes you manage tools. PAI creates a **network of specialized agents** that manage everything for you - while you sleep, your research agent finds Japan travel deals, your security agent scans for vulnerabilities, and your content agent writes your next blog post.

### The 6 Specialists Working for You

- 🔍 **Code Analysis**: Security scanning, performance analysis
- ✍️ **Content Generation**: Blog posts, research synthesis  
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure**: Docker management, service monitoring
- 🔒 **Security**: Threat detection, compliance protection
- 📊 **Research**: Intelligence gathering, trend analysis
- ⚙️ **Workflow**: Process automation, task orchestration

### Core Philosophy: Composable Intelligence

**Simple agents combine to create extraordinary outcomes:**
- Research + Content = Thought leadership articles
- Security + Infrastructure = Zero-trust home lab that runs itself
- Travel Research + Financial Planning = Optimized international lifestyle

## Current Status

**Phase 2 (Aug 28 - Oct 2, 2025)**: Building the core agents
- [ ] Code Analysis Agent 
- [ ] Content Generation Agent
- [ ] Infrastructure Agent
- [ ] Basic inter-agent communication

**Tech Stack**: Fabric AI (209 patterns) • n8n • Docker • TypeScript • SearxNG • Firecrawl

## The Future Experience

Instead of: *"I need to use AI to help me write this blog post"*  
You'll say: *"Buddy, optimize my 2-country travel plan for next year"*  

And while you focus on strategy, your agents handle research, content creation, security compliance, and infrastructure management - autonomously.
