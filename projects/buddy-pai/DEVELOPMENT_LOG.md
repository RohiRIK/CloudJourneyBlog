## Technical Decision Log

### Decision 1: Agent Framework Architecture
**Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Decision**: Use TypeScript with shared interface design  
**Rationale**: Type safety, VS Code integration, existing project patterns  
**Impact**: Faster development, better maintainability  

### Decision 2: Context Management Strategy
**Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Decision**: Centralized context manager with agent-specific access controls  
**Rationale**: Security, scalability, consistent data access  
**Impact**: Secure data sharing, better collaboration between agents  

### Decision 3: Fabric AI Integration Approach
**Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Decision**: Direct pattern integration with agent-specific model selection  
**Rationale**: Leverage existing 209 patterns, optimize for specific use cases  
**Impact**: Immediate capability boost, consistent output quality

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complexity Management
**Issue**: Risk of over-engineering in early phases  
**Solution**: Start with single agent, iterative development  
**Status**: Mitigated through incremental approach  

### Challenge 2: Integration Testing
**Issue**: Testing inter-agent communication before full system  
**Solution**: Mock interfaces and gradual integration  
**Status**: Planned for Week 2 testing framework  

### Challenge 3: Performance Optimization
**Issue**: Ensuring agents don't slow down overall system  
**Solution**: Performance monitoring from day 1  
**Status**: Metrics framework to be implemented

## User Feedback & Adjustments

### Feedback Session 1 (August 7, 2025)
**User Input**: "Create the folders and document my goals"  
**Action Taken**: 
- Created complete PAI directory structure
- Generated comprehensive goals documentation
- Integrated Daniel Miessler's proven approach

**Outcome**: Foundation established, clear direction set

### Next Feedback Session: Week 2
**Planned Topics**:
- Code Analysis Agent initial implementation review
- User experience with agent interaction
- Adjustments to communication style and functionality

---

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Agent Communication Complexity**: Mitigated by starting simple
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitoring built in from start
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Security-first design principle

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Controlled by phase-based development
- **User Adoption**: Regular feedback and adjustment cycles
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Self-improving design reduces manual work

## Notes & Insights

### Development Philosophy
Following Daniel Miessler's approach: "Build modular services that can combine into powerful capabilities." Each agent is a service that can work independently or collaborate for complex tasks.

### User-Centric Design
Every decision filtered through "Does this make Rohi's life better?" - not just "Is this technically interesting?" The goal is practical empowerment, not technical showcase.

### Continuous Learning
System designed to learn from every interaction and improve over time. What works well gets enhanced, what doesn't gets modified or replaced.
