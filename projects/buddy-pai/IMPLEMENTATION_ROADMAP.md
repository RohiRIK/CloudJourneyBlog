## Technical Implementation Details

### Agent Framework Template
```typescript
// Location: pai/shared/interfaces/BuddyAgent.ts
interface BuddyAgent {
  name: string;
  purpose: string;
  capabilities: string[];
  tools: Tool[];
  context: SharedContext;
  
  // Core methods for all agents
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  process(request: AgentRequest): Promise<AgentResponse>;
  collaborate(agents: BuddyAgent[], task: Task): Promise<Result>;
  learn(feedback: Feedback): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Shared Context Architecture
```typescript
// Location: pai/shared/context/ContextManager.ts
interface SharedContext {
  user_profile: UserProfile;
  project_state: ProjectState;
  active_tasks: Task[];
  knowledge_cache: KnowledgeCache;
  security_context: SecurityContext;
}
```

### Code Analysis Agent Priorities
```yaml
capabilities:
  - security_scanning: "Automated vulnerability detection"
  - code_review: "Quality and best practice analysis"
  - performance_analysis: "Performance bottleneck identification"
  - documentation_check: "Documentation completeness validation"

fabric_patterns:
  - "coding_master": "Advanced code analysis and review"
  - "analyze_malware": "Security vulnerability detection"
  - "improve_code": "Code quality and optimization suggestions"

integration_points:
  - git_hooks: "Automatic triggering on commits"
  - vscode_extension: "Real-time code analysis"
  - security_workflows: "Integration with existing security processes"
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **Agent Communication Complexity**: Start with simple message passing, evolve gradually
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor response times, implement caching strategies
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Security-first design, regular audit cycles

### Project Risks
- **Feature Creep**: Strict adherence to phase-based development
- **User Adoption**: Regular feedback cycles, iterative improvement
- **Integration Issues**: Comprehensive testing, fallback mechanisms

### Success Factors
- **Incremental Value**: Each week delivers working functionality
- **User-Centric Focus**: Every feature improves Rohi's daily experience
- **Quality Over Speed**: Solid foundation enables rapid future development

---

## Measurement & Feedback

### Weekly Metrics
- **Agent Response Time**: Target < 2 seconds
- **Task Success Rate**: Target > 95%
- **User Satisfaction**: Target 8/10 or higher
- **Code Coverage**: Target > 80% for new components

### User Feedback Schedule
- **Daily**: Quick interaction quality check
- **Weekly**: Comprehensive functionality review
- **Bi-weekly**: Goal alignment and priority adjustment

### Technical Health Checks
- **Performance**: Response times, resource usage
- **Security**: Credential protection, vulnerability detection
- **Reliability**: Error rates, uptime statistics
