### **HISTORY**

- **H1:** I grew up in Kibbutz Beit Kama in the Negev, Israel.
- **H2:** I've always been a little bit chubby, or at least I felt more so than I really was.
- **H3:** I played volleyball in high school.
- **H4:** I served in the military for three years, from 2014 to 2017, spending most of that time in Aouysh.
- **H5:** After the army, I worked at a factory in Kibbutz Be’eri as a machine operator producing envelopes.
- **H6:** I lived there for about a year and had a lot of fun.
- **H7:** Around this time, I switched from Apple Music to YouTube Music. For the same price as the streaming service, I also got YouTube Premium without ads! This was a killer feature. When Spotify arrived in Israel a few months later, I didn't bother to switch.
- **H8:** After spending a few more months in Beit Kama, I started a fitness trainer course and sublet an apartment in Tel Aviv for two months to see if I wanted to live there.
- **H9:** I traveled in North India for a month with a friend I met in Be’eri.
- **H10:** I came back to my kibbutz and returned to work in Be’eri. After three months, I dreamed of going back to South India for the Sunsplash Festival (a reggae festival).
- **H11:** A few months later, when the excitement faded, I decided to move to Ramat Gan with a friend from Be’eri.
- **H12:** In Ramat Gan, I started working as a fitness trainer. I stopped working during the COVID period.
- **H13:** Most days, I would wake up at 9:00 AM and start the morning with coffee from my crappy De'Longhi espresso machine with its pressurized portafilter.
- **H14:** Then, I would start my workout, always leaving time for a nap and finishing the day with a 10 km walk from Ramat Gan to Tel Aviv through Yarkon Park. I worked very little, which gave me more time for my welding hobby.
- **H15:** At the same time, I started working with kettlebells and became very enthusiastic about it. I also practiced Animal Flow.
- **H16:** When I wasn't working out, I spent my time smoking weed, and after a while, I found I couldn't sleep without it.
- **H17:** I still remember that time fondly. During this period, I realized I didn't want to continue in fitness and started thinking more seriously about a career in high-tech.
- **H18:** After a few months, I started working at a beer shop. I liked the job and the free beer, but the pay wasn't good.
- **H19:** I moved to Tel Aviv, still working at the beer shop but seeking a better job.
- **H20:** I started working in coffee shops and took a seven-month cybersecurity course.
- **H21:** I started working as a cloud security engineer at an integration company. Without any prior knowledge of the cloud, they asked me to do a presentation explaining my learning process.
- **H22:** At first, the job was overwhelming. I didn't understand what we did, how to manage my tasks, and more.
- **H23:** I searched for ways to manage my tasks and found Notion, where I quickly started building templates.
- **H24:** I bought my first Orange Pi, connected to it with SSH, and installed basic Docker services. I was truly amazed. I also started to build automations in Pipedream that leveraged my Notion API for my tasks. The first one was a weekly summary of completed and open tasks, delivered to my inbox at the start and end of each week.
- **H25:** I met Maya, and we started dating.
- **H26:** With Maya, I also became a step-dad to her dog, Lizi. It didn't happen right away, but now I'm the one who takes Lizi for walks most of the time.
- **H27:** I learned so much from Maya about partnership, love, how to respect each other, how to talk about feelings, and also how to taste food.
- **H28:** I started learning about the "second brain" concept in Notion and began building my own system using areas, projects, tasks, and notes.
- **H29:** We had a few bumps at the start, but we managed to get through them.
- **H30:** She was amazing, and I truly enjoyed getting to know her and being with her. She is the most beautiful person I’ve ever known. I’m lucky she felt I was worth fighting for, even after I messed things up.
- **H31:** We moved in together.
- **H32:** I bought my Flair 58 espresso machine to elevate my coffee at home.
- **H33:** Maya surprised me and bought us tickets to London (at the time, I hadn't traveled in over five years). We also decided to buy tickets for a Damian Marley concert, which was a dream come true.
- **H34:** I started to learn more about Docker.
- **H35:** I bought an Intel i9 NUC and started to create a home lab. I built a good stack, running Traefik as a reverse proxy, n8n for automation orchestration, Portainer, and more.
- **H36:** I became more and more interested in automations.
- **H37:** After a few months, she did it again and bought us tickets to Copenhagen.

### **PROBLEMS**

- **P1:** I’m tired of living in a country that’s constantly at war.
- **P2:** Organic food and quality vegetables are too expensive.
- **P3:** Why are there no apartments available in the kibbutz?
- **P4:** I’ve gained weight over the past year and I want to lose it.
- **P5:** I want to have enough money to buy whatever I want.
- **P6:** I don’t enjoy working out at home anymore, and I feel that paying for a gym is too expensive.
- **P7:** I often feel anxious about my future.

- **P10:** Living with Maya’s brother is not easy.
- **P11:** Finding an apartment to move into isn’t easy. I’m tired of living in Tel Aviv or any other city in Israel.
- **P12:** I'm not even thirty, and I have heartburn all the time.
- **P13:** In the past, I had a few panic attacks caused by my job and other things in my life.
- **P14:** I'm not sure if there's room for advancement in my current job.
