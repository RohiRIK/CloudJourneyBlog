# Automate Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Deployment with n8n

## Description
Utilize n8n to create a workflow for deploying and managing multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This task should also enable Buddy AI to initiate and manage these deployments, providing an option for self-service deployment.

## Key Objectives

### 1. Research & Learning (Leveraging Fabric-AI)
- **MCP Server Fundamentals**: Deep dive into the architecture, deployment requirements, and common use cases of MCP servers. Understand their role in facilitating communication between AI models and data sources.
- **n8n Capabilities for Server Provisioning**: Explore n8n's capabilities for system automation, specifically for server provisioning (e.g., using SSH, Docker, cloud APIs like AWS, Azure, GCP, or a local hypervisor) relevant to MCP server deployment.
- **Fabric-AI for Knowledge Acquisition**: Utilize Fabric-AI to accelerate the learning process. This includes using Fabric-AI patterns to:
    - Summarize documentation on MCP servers and n8n automation.
    - Extract key information on best practices for server provisioning.
    - Generate questions or prompts for further research on specific technical challenges.

### 2. n8n Workflow Design & Implementation
- **Parameterization**: Design an n8n workflow that can accept parameters for MCP server configuration (e.g., server name, specific protocol versions, data source connections, security settings).
- **Provisioning Logic**: Implement nodes for:
    - Provisioning a new server instance suitable for an MCP server (e.g., creating a Docker container, a VM, or interacting with a cloud provider API).
    - Installing necessary dependencies and configuring the MCP server software.
    - Ensuring the MCP server runs persistently and is accessible.
    - Handling potential errors and providing robust logging.
- **Feedback & Monitoring**: Design the workflow to provide clear feedback on deployment status and potential issues.

### 3. Buddy AI Integration
- **Triggering Workflows**: Explore how Buddy AI can trigger this n8n workflow, passing the necessary parameters for MCP server deployment.
- **Status Monitoring**: Investigate how Buddy AI can monitor the status of the n8n workflow execution and the deployed MCP server.
- **Self-Service Option**: Implement a command or process within Buddy AI that allows the user to request a new MCP server deployment, with Buddy AI handling the n8n interaction.

## Status
- **Overall Status**: To Do
- **Assigned To**: Buddy / Rohi (Collaborative)
- **Priority**: High

## Notes
This task requires significant learning and exploration into MCP server technology, n8n automation, and Fabric-AI integration. The goal is to create a highly efficient and automated solution for MCP server deployment, leveraging the strengths of all involved tools.
