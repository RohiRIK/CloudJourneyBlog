# Action Item: Improve Documentation Synchronization

**Overview**: This action item addresses the need to improve the process for synchronizing Buddy AI's core instruction files, `.gemini/GEMINI.md` and `projects/buddy-ai/buddy-instructions.md`.

**Current Status**: Planning
**Priority Level**: Medium

## Problem Statement

The current process for keeping the two core instruction files synchronized is manual and prone to error. This can lead to inconsistencies in Buddy AI's behavior and a lack of clarity about its core directives.

## Proposed Solutions

- **Implement an Automated Synchronization Script**: Create a script that automatically synchronizes the two files whenever a change is made to either one. This script could be triggered by a file system watcher or a Git hook.
- **Establish a Single Source of Truth**: Designate one of the two files as the single source of truth and create a process for automatically generating the other file from it. This would eliminate the possibility of inconsistencies.

## Success Criteria

- The two core instruction files are always kept in sync.
- The process for updating Buddy AI's core instructions is simplified and less prone to error.

## Implementation Plan

- **Phase 1 (V4)**: Design and develop the automated synchronization script or the single-source-of-truth system.
- **Phase 2 (V4)**: Implement the new system.
- **Phase 3 (V4)**: Test the new system to ensure it is working correctly.

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk**: The automated synchronization script could fail or introduce errors.
- **Mitigation**: The script should be thoroughly tested and should include error handling and logging to ensure any issues are quickly identified and resolved.
