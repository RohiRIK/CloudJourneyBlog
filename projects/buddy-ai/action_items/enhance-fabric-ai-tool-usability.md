# Enhance Fabric AI Tool for Better Usability and Smoother Experience

## Description
Based on user feedback, the `fabric-ai.rohi.life` service needs significant improvements to make it more intuitive, user-friendly, and self-documenting. This task is focused on enhancing the core tool to reduce the need for repeated explanations and make it easier for both humans and AI to use effectively.

## Key Objectives

### 1. Create Interactive API Documentation
- Implement a Swagger UI or OpenAPI interface for the `fabric-ai.rohi.life` API.
- This should provide a live, browsable documentation of all endpoints, including `/chat`, `/models`, and `/patterns`.
- Each endpoint should have clear descriptions, parameter details, and example requests/responses.

### 2. Develop a User-Friendly Web Interface
- Build a simple web front-end for `fabric-ai.rohi.life`.
- This UI should allow users to:
    - Select a model from a dropdown list.
    - Select a pattern from a dropdown list.
    - Enter text into an input box.
    - See the formatted output directly on the page.
- This will eliminate the need for `curl` for simple tests and make the tool accessible to non-developers.

### 3. Improve Error Messaging and Feedback
- Refactor the API to return clear, descriptive error messages.
- For example, instead of a generic `500 Internal Server Error`, provide specific feedback like `Model 'xyz' not found` or `Invalid API Key`.

### 4. Create Comprehensive "How-To" Guides
- Write step-by-step guides for common tasks and workflows.
- These guides should be stored in `docs/fabric-ai/` and cover topics like:
    - "How to Add a New Pattern"
    - "How to Connect Fabric AI to n8n"
    - "Troubleshooting Common Fabric AI Issues"

### 5. Streamline Configuration and Setup
- Review and simplify the `.env.example` file in `infrastructure/fabric-ai/`.
- Add comments to explain each variable clearly.
- Create a `setup-check.sh` script that verifies the configuration and dependencies.
