# Action Item: Refine Process Adherence and Judgment

**Overview**: This action item addresses the need to improve Buddy AI's ability to select the appropriate process for a given task by refining its judgment and process adherence.

**Current Status**: Planning
**Priority Level**: Medium

## Problem Statement

Buddy AI's effectiveness is dependent on its ability to correctly assess the complexity of a user's request and select the appropriate process (simple task, multi-step workflow, or Action Item). Misinterpreting the complexity of a request can lead to using a process that is either too simple or too bureaucratic for the task at hand.

## Proposed Solutions

- **Develop a More Sophisticated Complexity-Assessment Model**: Create a more sophisticated model for assessing the complexity of a user's request. This model could take into account factors such as the number of steps involved, the number of systems affected, and the level of uncertainty.
- **Implement a Feedback Loop for Process Selection**: Create a feedback loop that allows the user to confirm or correct Buddy AI's choice of process. This would help to ensure that the correct process is always used.

## Success Criteria

- Buddy AI is able to more accurately assess the complexity of a user's request.
- The user is able to easily correct Buddy AI's choice of process when necessary.

## Implementation Plan

- **Phase 1 (V4)**: Design and develop the new complexity-assessment model.
- **Phase 2 (V4)**: Implement the feedback loop for process selection.
- **Phase 3 (V4)**: Test the new systems to ensure they are working correctly.

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk**: The new complexity-assessment model may still not be perfect.
- **Mitigation**: The model should be designed to be easily updated and refined over time as new data and insights become available.
