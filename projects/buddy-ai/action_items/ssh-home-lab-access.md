## Description
Establish a robust and efficient workflow for Buddy AI to securely connect to the user's home lab server via SSH from the macOS environment. This includes defining commands and processes for common server management tasks, ensuring security, and optimizing for efficiency.

## Key Objectives

### 1. Secure SSH Connection Establishment
- **SSH Key Management**: Implement best practices for managing SSH keys (generation, secure storage, and usage) for authentication.
- **Configuration**: Configure SSH client settings (e.g., `~/.ssh/config`) for simplified and secure connections to the home lab server.
- **Initial Connection Test**: Verify successful and secure SSH connectivity.

### 2. Define Common Workflow Commands
- **File Transfer**: Establish efficient methods for transferring files to and from the home lab server (e.g., `scp`, `rsync`).
- **Remote Command Execution**: Define patterns for executing commands remotely and capturing their output.
- **Process Management**: Outline commands for starting, stopping, and monitoring processes on the server.
- **Log Review**: Define methods for accessing and reviewing server logs.

### 3. Automation and Efficiency Considerations
- **Scripting**: Explore opportunities for scripting common sequences of commands (e.g., Bash scripts, Python scripts).
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling within the workflow to provide clear feedback and recovery options.
- **Interactive vs. Non-Interactive**: Differentiate between tasks requiring interactive sessions and those that can be automated non-interactively.

### 4. Buddy AI Integration
- **Command Exposure**: Expose key SSH-related commands and workflows through Buddy AI's interface.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Enable Buddy AI to understand the context of home lab tasks and suggest relevant SSH commands or workflows.
- **Security Best Practices**: Ensure all automated SSH interactions adhere to strict security protocols.

## Status
- **Overall Status**: To Do
- **Assigned To**: Buddy / Rohi (Collaborative)
- **Priority**: High

## Notes
This task is crucial for expanding Buddy AI's capabilities to manage external infrastructure. It requires careful consideration of security, efficiency, and user experience.
