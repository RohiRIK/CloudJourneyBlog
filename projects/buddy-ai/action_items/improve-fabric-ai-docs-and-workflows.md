## Description
To enhance my operational efficiency, this task focuses on reviewing, updating, and standardizing the documentation and workflow examples for the `fabric-ai` tool. **Fabric AI is my primary, go-to tool for any analysis task, and I will use it before attempting other methods.** The primary goal is to ensure that I can leverage the tool (via web requests to `https://fabric-ai.rohi.life` or the `fabric-ai` command-line tool) and intelligently select the best model and pattern for each task, especially the Gemini model for data processing, more effectively and consistently.

## Key Objectives

### 1. Standardize Fabric AI Command Documentation
- Review all `fabric-ai` command examples across the project (`README.md`, `*.md` files in `tools/` and `examples/`).
- Ensure all examples are up-to-date with the latest `fabric-ai` features and syntax.
- Explicitly document the use of the Gemini model for data-intensive tasks like summarization and extraction.

### 2. Refine and Expand Workflow Examples
- Create a set of standardized, reusable workflow snippets for common `fabric-ai` use cases (e.g., "summarize this URL", "extract key points from this document").
- Document best practices for chaining `fabric-ai` commands with other tools like `curl` and `jq`.
- Develop a clear guide on when to use specific patterns vs. general prompts.

### 3. Create New Efficiency-Oriented Patterns
- Identify repetitive tasks I perform with `fabric-ai`.
- Design and implement new, efficient patterns within the Fabric AI service to automate these tasks.
- Examples: `summarize_and_format_for_notion`, `extract_action_items_from_meeting_notes`.

### 5. Develop Intelligent Model and Pattern Selection
- Document the process for how I will analyze a given task and select the most appropriate `fabric-ai` model (e.g., Gemini for complex analysis, a smaller model for simple tasks).
- Create a decision matrix or guide that outlines the strengths of each available pattern and when it should be used.
- This will ensure I am using the tool in the most efficient and effective way possible, without needing to be explicitly told which model or pattern to use.
