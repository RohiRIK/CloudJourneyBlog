# Improve Fabric AI Documentation and Workflows for Efficiency

## Description
To enhance my operational efficiency, this task focuses on reviewing, updating, and standardizing the documentation and workflow examples for the `fabric-ai` tool. The primary goal is to ensure that I can leverage the tool, especially the Gemini model, for data processing tasks more effectively and consistently.

## Key Objectives

### 1. Standardize Fabric AI Command Documentation
- Review all `fabric-ai` command examples across the project (`README.md`, `*.md` files in `tools/` and `examples/`).
- Ensure all examples are up-to-date with the latest `fabric-ai` features and syntax.
- Explicitly document the use of the Gemini model for data-intensive tasks like summarization and extraction.

### 2. Refine and Expand Workflow Examples
- Create a set of standardized, reusable workflow snippets for common `fabric-ai` use cases (e.g., "summarize this URL", "extract key points from this document").
- Document best practices for chaining `fabric-ai` commands with other tools like `curl` and `jq`.
- Develop a clear guide on when to use specific patterns vs. general prompts.

### 3. Create New Efficiency-Oriented Patterns
- Identify repetitive tasks I perform with `fabric-ai`.
- Design and implement new, efficient patterns within the Fabric AI service to automate these tasks.
- Examples: `summarize_and_format_for_notion`, `extract_action_items_from_meeting_notes`.

### 4. Update My Internal Knowledge Base
- Once the documentation is improved, I will re-index the relevant files to update my internal knowledge about `fabric-ai`.
- This will ensure I use the new, efficient methods by default.
