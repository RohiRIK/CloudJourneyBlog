# GitHub Action: API Key Sanitizer for Uploaded Files

## Description
Develop a GitHub Action that automatically detects and sanitizes API keys or other sensitive credentials within files uploaded to the repository. The action should replace identified sensitive strings with a placeholder (e.g., `[REDACTED_API_KEY]`) to prevent accidental exposure.

## Key Objectives

### 1. Research & Detection Methods
- **Pattern Identification**: Research common patterns and regular expressions for identifying various types of API keys, tokens, and sensitive credentials (e.g., AWS access keys, Azure client secrets, generic API tokens).
- **Existing Solutions**: Investigate existing open-source tools or GitHub Actions designed for secret scanning or sanitization to inform our approach.
- **Scope Definition**: Determine the scope of files to be scanned (e.g., all new/modified files, specific file types).

### 2. GitHub Action Implementation
- **Trigger**: Configure the action to trigger on relevant events (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`).
- **Scanning Logic**: Implement the logic to scan file contents for identified patterns.
- **Sanitization**: Develop a mechanism to replace detected sensitive strings with a predefined placeholder. This should ideally be done in a way that modifies the file in the commit or prevents the commit from being pushed.
- **Reporting**: Provide clear output or status checks indicating whether sensitive data was found and sanitized.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for cases where patterns are not found or replacement fails.

### 3. Integration & Best Practices
- **`.gitignore` Integration**: Ensure this action complements existing `.gitignore` rules and doesn't interfere with intentionally ignored files.
- **False Positives/Negatives**: Consider strategies to minimize false positives and false negatives.
- **Security Considerations**: Emphasize that this is a *sanitization* step, and proper secret management (e.g., environment variables, secret management services) should be the primary method for handling sensitive data.

## Status
- **Overall Status**: To Do
- **Assigned To**: Buddy / Rohi (Collaborative)
- **Priority**: Critical

## Notes
This action is vital for enhancing the security posture of the repository by preventing accidental exposure of sensitive information. It requires careful design and testing to ensure effectiveness and reliability.
