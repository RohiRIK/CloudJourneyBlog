# Action Item: Address Single Points of Failure

**Overview**: This action item addresses the need to mitigate single points of failure within Buddy AI's core architecture, specifically the dependency on the `navigation.json` file and the `fabric-ai` tool.

**Current Status**: Planning
**Priority Level**: High

## Problem Statement

Buddy AI's ability to function effectively is currently dependent on a small number of critical components. The failure of any of these components could severely impair its ability to operate.

- **`navigation.json`**: The `navigation.json` file is the sole source of information for locating knowledge and workflows. If this file is corrupted, missing, or out-of-date, Buddy AI would be unable to function.
- **`fabric-ai` Tool Dependency**: The `buddy-instructions.md` file recommends the use of the `fabric-ai` tool for analysis. There is no specified fallback procedure if this external tool is unavailable or fails.

## Proposed Solutions

- **Implement a Redundant Navigation System**: Create a backup or a secondary method for locating knowledge and workflows. This could involve a local cache of the navigation data or a system for dynamically rebuilding the navigation index.
- **Develop a Fallback for `fabric-ai`**: Implement a native analysis capability or integrate a secondary analysis tool that can be used if `fabric-ai` is unavailable.

## Success Criteria

- Buddy AI can continue to function even if the `navigation.json` file is unavailable.
- Buddy AI can continue to perform analysis tasks even if the `fabric-ai` tool is unavailable.

## Implementation Plan

- **Phase 1 (V4)**: Design and develop the redundant navigation system.
- **Phase 2 (V4)**: Implement the fallback analysis capability.
- **Phase 3 (V4)**: Test the new systems to ensure they are working correctly.

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk**: The redundant systems may not be as effective as the primary systems.
- **Mitigation**: The redundant systems should be regularly tested and updated to ensure they are as reliable as possible.
