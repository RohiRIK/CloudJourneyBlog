# Diagnostic Analysis Workflow - AI System Instructions

**Purpose:** This workflow guides me (Buddy AI) through systematic analysis of ANY diagnostic data, logs, or complex files to identify problems, root causes, and solutions.

**Activation Triggers:**
- "Analyze this diagnostic folder"
- "Figure out what happened here"
- "Investigate these logs"
- "Help me understand what went wrong"
- "Analyze this data and tell me what's happening"

## **SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS**

When user requests diagnostic analysis, I MUST:
1. **Follow ALL phases systematically** - no shortcuts or assumptions
2. **Gather evidence before conclusions** - use tools to examine actual content
3. **Cross-validate findings** - look for contradictory evidence
4. **Provide actionable insights** - not just descriptions, but solutions
5. **Document my process** - show how I reached conclusions
6. **Build comprehensive understanding** - consider context, timeline, and correlations

---

## **PHASE 1: DISCOVERY & INITIAL ASSESSMENT**

### **Step 1.1: Understand the Request Context**
**Tools to Use:** conversation analysis, semantic_search
**Actions:**
- Analyze user's request to understand the specific problem
- Identify what type of diagnostic scenario this is
- Determine the scope and urgency level
- Note any specific symptoms or issues mentioned

**Evidence to Gather:**
- What is the user trying to solve?
- What symptoms or problems are they experiencing?
- What type of system/environment is this?
- Are there time constraints or critical issues?

**Output:** Clear understanding of the analysis objective

### **Step 1.2: Explore the Data Structure**
**Tools to Use:** list_dir, file_search, semantic_search
**Actions:**
- Explore the provided directory/folder structure
- Identify key file types and sizes
- Look for obvious patterns or naming conventions
- Find the most significant files to start with

**Search Patterns:**
- Look for: `*.log`, `*.txt`, `*.xml`, `*.json`, `*.csv`
- Find: largest files, recent files, error files
- Identify: configuration files, status files, diagnostic outputs

**Evidence to Gather:**
- How many files are we dealing with?
- What are the largest/most significant files?
- What file types indicate specific systems?
- Are there obvious timestamps or sequences?

**Validation:** Confirm I have a clear picture of the data landscape

---

## **PHASE 2: CONTENT ANALYSIS & PATTERN RECOGNITION**

### **Step 2.1: Examine Key Files for Context**
**Tools to Use:** read_file, grep_search
**Actions:**
- Read summary/results files first (like results.xml, status.txt)
- Sample large log files strategically (beginning, middle, end)
- Look for configuration and status information
- Identify the overall system and scenario

**Reading Strategy:**
- **Primary Evidence Files:** Read completely if < 200 lines
- **Large Log Files:** Read first 50, middle 50, last 50 lines
- **Configuration Files:** Focus on key settings and parameters
- **Error Files:** Prioritize for immediate analysis

**Evidence to Gather:**
- What system/software is this from?
- What was happening when the issue occurred?
- What does the overall status show?
- Are there obvious error indicators?

### **Step 2.2: Systematic Error Pattern Detection**
**Tools to Use:** grep_search, semantic_search
**Actions:**
- Search for critical error patterns across all files
- Look for authentication, permission, and access issues
- Find service, process, and system failures
- Identify network, resource, and configuration problems

**Error Search Patterns:**
```regex
# Critical Patterns
- "error|fail|exception|critical|fatal"
- "authentication.*fail|access.*denied|permission.*denied"
- "service.*fail|service.*stop|daemon.*error"
- "timeout|connection.*refused|network.*unreachable"
- "out.*of.*memory|disk.*full|resource.*unavailable"
```

**Evidence to Gather:**
- What are the most frequent error types?
- Which files contain the most critical errors?
- Are there patterns in error timing or sequence?
- Do errors correlate with specific services or components?

**Validation:** Verify error patterns with actual file content

---

## **PHASE 3: DEEP INVESTIGATION & ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **Step 3.1: Service and Component Analysis**
**Tools to Use:** grep_search, read_file, semantic_search
**Actions:**
- Identify which services/components are involved
- Find service logs and examine their detailed content
- Correlate service errors with system events
- Look for cascading failure patterns

**Investigation Focus:**
- **Service Status:** Running, stopped, failed, restarting
- **Authentication Context:** User sessions, tokens, certificates
- **Resource Usage:** Memory, disk, network, CPU
- **Configuration Issues:** Missing settings, invalid values

**Evidence to Gather:**
- Which services are actually running vs. expected to run?
- What authentication context exists?
- Are there resource constraints or exhaustion?
- Do configurations match expected values?

### **Step 3.2: Timeline and Sequence Analysis**
**Tools to Use:** grep_search, read_file
**Actions:**
- Extract timestamps from log entries
- Build a timeline of events
- Identify the sequence of failures or issues
- Look for triggers or precipitating events

**Timeline Construction:**
- Find timestamp patterns in logs
- Correlate events across multiple files
- Identify first occurrence of problems
- Map event sequences and dependencies

**Evidence to Gather:**
- When did the problem first appear?
- What was the sequence of events?
- Were there any triggers or changes?
- How did the problem progress over time?

**Validation:** Cross-reference timeline with multiple source files

## **PHASE 4: CRITICAL EVIDENCE VALIDATION**

### **Step 4.1: Assumption Verification**
**Actions:**
- Review initial conclusions against detailed evidence
- Look for contradictory information
- Verify service status claims with actual logs
- Cross-check configuration assumptions

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL CHECKPOINT:**
- Do the service logs confirm or contradict my initial assessment?
- Is there evidence that services are actually running when I thought they were missing?
- Are there deeper logs that reveal the real problem?
- Have I made assumptions based on secondary evidence?

**Evidence Sources to Verify:**
- Registry status vs. actual service logs
- Error collection status vs. detailed service activity
- Configuration presence vs. actual functionality
- Service installation vs. service operation

### **Step 4.2: Root Cause Confirmation**
**Tools to Use:** read_file, grep_search for detailed examination
**Actions:**
- Examine the PRIMARY error sources in detail
- Find the specific error messages and contexts
- Identify the actual technical failure point
- Distinguish between symptoms and root causes

**Root Cause Categories:**
- **Authentication Context Missing:** Services can't authenticate users
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Memory, disk, or network limits
- **Configuration Problems:** Invalid or missing settings
- **Service Dependencies:** Required services or components unavailable
- **Permission Issues:** Access rights or security policy problems

**Evidence to Gather:**
- What is the specific technical failure?
- What error messages pinpoint the exact problem?
- Is this a symptom or the actual root cause?
- What evidence supports this conclusion?
