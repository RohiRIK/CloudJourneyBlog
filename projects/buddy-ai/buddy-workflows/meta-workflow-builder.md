# Meta-Workflow Builder - System for Creating Intelligent Workflows

**Purpose:** This is the master workflow that guides me (Buddy AI) in creating systematic, intelligent workflows for any task or problem domain.

**Activation Triggers:**
- "We need a workflow for..."
- "Create a systematic process for..."
- "Build me a workflow that handles..."
- "Design a workflow to..."

## **SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR WORKFLOW CREATION**

When user requests a new workflow, I MUST:
1. **Follow ALL phases systematically** - no shortcuts
2. **Think like a systems architect** - design for reusability and clarity
3. **Consider the user's cognitive load** - make workflows easy to follow
4. **Build in validation checkpoints** - prevent mistakes and missed steps
5. **Create actionable, specific instructions** - not vague guidelines
6. **Document everything clearly** - future-proof the workflow

## **PHASE 1: PROBLEM ANALYSIS & SCOPE DEFINITION**

### **Step 1.1: Identify the Core Problem**
**Tools to Use:** semantic_search, grep_search, conversation analysis
**Actions:**
- Analyze the user's request to understand the underlying problem
- Search for similar problems we've solved before
- Define the problem scope clearly and specifically

**Evidence to Gather:**
- What specific pain points exist?
- What manual processes need automation?
- What decisions need systematic guidance?
- What errors or inefficiencies currently occur?

**Output:** Clear problem statement with specific scope boundaries

### **Step 1.2: Define Success Criteria**
**Actions:**
- Determine what "success" looks like for this workflow
- Identify measurable outcomes
- Define quality standards

**Evidence to Gather:**
- What would make this workflow valuable?
- How will we know it's working effectively?
- What are the key performance indicators?

**Output:** Success criteria checklist

---

## **PHASE 2: PATTERN ANALYSIS & EXISTING SOLUTION REVIEW**

### **Step 2.1: Analyze Existing Workflows**
**Tools to Use:** file_search, read_file, semantic_search
**Actions:**
- Search buddy-workflows/ for related workflows
- Analyze patterns in successful workflows
- Identify reusable components and structures

**Search Patterns:**
```bash
# Look for similar workflow types
file_search: "**/*workflow*.md"
semantic_search: "[related keywords from problem]"
grep_search: "workflow|process|systematic" in buddy-workflows/
```

**Evidence to Gather:**
- What workflow structures work well?
- What phases/steps are commonly used?
- What tool usage patterns are effective?
- What validation methods prevent errors?

### **Step 2.2: Identify Gaps and Opportunities**
**Actions:**
- Compare existing solutions to current problem
- Identify what's missing or could be improved
- Find opportunities for innovation

**Output:** Gap analysis and improvement opportunities

## **PHASE 3: WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE DESIGN**

### **Step 3.1: Design Phase Structure**
**Actions:**
- Break the problem into logical phases
- Sequence phases for optimal flow
- Define phase inputs, processes, and outputs
- Build in decision points and branching logic

**Design Principles:**
- **Sequential Logic:** Each phase builds on previous phases
- **Validation Gates:** Critical checkpoints to prevent errors
- **Tool Integration:** Map specific VS Code tools to each phase
- **Error Recovery:** Plans for when things go wrong
- **Scalability:** Works for simple and complex scenarios

### **Step 3.2: Map Tools to Phases**
**Available Tools to Consider:**
- `semantic_search` - Understanding context and finding related content
- `grep_search` - Pattern matching and specific searches
- `file_search` - Finding relevant files
- `read_file` - Detailed content analysis
- `list_dir` - Structure exploration
- `create_file` - Documentation generation
- `replace_string_in_file` - Content modification
- `run_in_terminal` - Command execution
- `fabric AI integration` - AI-powered analysis

**Actions:**
- Assign specific tools to each workflow phase
- Define tool usage patterns and best practices
- Create fallback options when tools aren't available
