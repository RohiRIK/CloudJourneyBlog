# Mastering Azure Emergency Access Accounts: [Specific Focus]

## What Are Emergency Access Accounts?

Emergency Access Accounts (also known as "break-glass" accounts) are...

## Why You Need Them

- Scenario 1: When normal admin access is blocked
- Scenario 2: During security incidents
- Scenario 3: Configuration mistakes lock out admins

## Setting Up Emergency Access Accounts

### Account Configuration

```powershell
# PowerShell commands for setup
Connect-AzureAD
New-AzureADUser -DisplayName "Emergency Access Account"
```

### Security Considerations

- Use strong, unique passwords stored securely
- Configure monitoring and alerting
- Regular access reviews

## Monitoring and Alerting

Set up alerts for emergency account usage:

```json
{
  "alertRule": {
    "name": "Emergency Account Usage",
    "condition": "signInLogs contains 'emergency-access'"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] Two separate emergency accounts created
- [ ] Accounts excluded from MFA policies
- [ ] Strong passwords stored in secure location
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Regular testing scheduled

## Testing Your Emergency Access

Monthly testing procedure...

## Conclusion

# Automate [Specific Task] with n8n: [Workflow Name]

## What We're Building

A complete automation workflow that will:
- [Specific outcome 1]
- [Specific outcome 2]
- [Specific outcome 3]

## Prerequisites

- n8n instance running (see [setup guide](link))
- Access to [required services/APIs]
- Basic understanding of n8n workflows

## The Workflow Architecture

```
Trigger → Processing → Integration → Output
   ↓         ↓           ↓         ↓
[Node]   [Node]     [API Call]  [Action]
```

## Building the Workflow

### Step 1: Set Up the Trigger

Configure the initial trigger node:

```json
{
  "triggerType": "webhook",
  "method": "POST",
  "path": "your-webhook-path"
}
```

### Step 2: Process the Data

Add data transformation nodes:

```javascript
// Function node code
const inputData = $input.all();
return inputData.map(item => ({
  processed: item.json.data,
  timestamp: new Date()
}));
```

### Step 3: External Integration

Connect to external services (Fabric AI, Notion, etc.):

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://fabric-ai.rohi.life/chat",
  "headers": {
    "X-API-Key": "{{$env.FABRIC_API_KEY}}"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Output and Actions

Final workflow actions and notifications.

## Testing the Workflow

How to test each component:

1. Test trigger with sample data
2. Verify data processing
3. Check external integrations
4. Validate final output

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Set up workflow monitoring
- Error handling strategies
- Performance optimization tips

## Workflow JSON Export

```json
{
  "workflow": {
    "name": "Your Workflow Name",
    "nodes": [
      // Complete workflow JSON
    ]
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

This automation workflow saves [time/effort] by...

## Next Steps

- Extend the workflow to handle [additional scenarios]
- Integrate with [other services]
- Set up monitoring and alerts
```
