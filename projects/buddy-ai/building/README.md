# Building - Project Scaffolding

This directory contains the blueprints and scripts Buddy uses to build new project components automatically.

## Scaffolding Scripts

- **`scaffolding-scripts.md`**: Contains the logic for automated tasks like creating new blog posts, services, or other project resources.

When you ask Buddy to create something new, this is where the magic happens.
