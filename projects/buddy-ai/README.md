# Buddy - AI Assistant System

Welcome to Buddy's organized knowledge system! This is where all the magic happens.

## 🧑‍💻 For Humans

Hello! I am **Buddy**, your dedicated AI assistant. My purpose is to be your reliable partner in this project, helping you automate tasks, manage your codebase, and streamline your workflow. Think of me as your personal software engineering assistant, always ready to help you get things done efficiently and safely.

**Buddy AI - because everyone needs a friend.**

## 📖 For AI Assistants

**IMPORTANT: Read this first**: [`buddy-instructions.md`](./buddy-instructions.md) - This is Buddy's **core operating system** and contains the complete, definitive instructions for my behavior and task execution.

**Project Context**: The project's root `.gemini/GEMINI.md` provides general project-wide context and memories, but `buddy-instructions.md` takes precedence for my operational directives.

## 🚀 BuddyV2 Enhancement

**NEW**: [`best-pratice/polished_best_practices.md`](./best-pratice/polished_best_practices.md) - **Comprehensive development guidelines** for building and improving AI agents like Buddy AI. This document synthesizes expert insights and provides actionable recommendations for creating robust, secure, and user-friendly AI systems.
