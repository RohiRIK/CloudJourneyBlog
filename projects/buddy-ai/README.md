# Buddy - AI Assistant System

Welcome to Buddy's organized knowledge system! This is where all the magic happens.

## 📖 For AI Assistants

**IMPORTANT: Read this first**: [`buddy-instructions.md`](./buddy-instructions.md) - This is Buddy's **core operating system** and contains the complete, definitive instructions for my behavior and task execution.

**Project Context**: The project's root `.gemini/GEMINI.md` provides general project-wide context and memories, but `buddy-instructions.md` takes precedence for my operational directives.
