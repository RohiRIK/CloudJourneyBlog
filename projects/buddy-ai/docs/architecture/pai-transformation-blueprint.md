   - `optimize_resources` → Performance-based scaling

### 2.3 Modular Service Integration

#### **Service Integration Architecture**

```yaml
service_integration:
  fabric_ai:
    models: 59
    patterns: 209
    strategies: 9
    integration_level: "deep"
    agents: ["content", "code_analysis", "research"]
    
  n8n_mcp:
    workflows: "automated"
    triggers: "event_driven"
    integration_level: "orchestration"
    agents: ["workflow", "infrastructure"]
    
  docker_infrastructure:
    services: ["traefik", "portainer", "monitoring"]
    integration_level: "management"
    agents: ["infrastructure", "security"]
    
  external_apis:
    firecrawl: "web_scraping"
    searxng: "search_aggregation"  
    integration_level: "tool_access"
    agents: ["research", "content"]
```

#### **Agent-Service Mapping**

**Content Generation Agent** ↔ **Services:**
- Fabric AI: Content creation patterns
- SearxNG: Research and information gathering
- Firecrawl: Web content extraction
- n8n: Content workflow automation

**Code Analysis Agent** ↔ **Services:**
- Fabric AI: Code analysis patterns
- Git: Repository integration
- Docker: Container analysis
- Security scanning tools

**Infrastructure Agent** ↔ **Services:**
- Docker: Container management
- n8n: Infrastructure workflows
- Monitoring: Health tracking
- Traefik: Service routing

### 2.4 Basic Context Management Implementation

#### **Shared Context Architecture**

```typescript
interface SharedContext {
  user_profile: UserProfile;
  project_state: ProjectState;
  active_tasks: Task[];
  agent_states: Map<string, AgentState>;
  knowledge_cache: KnowledgeCache;
  security_context: SecurityContext;
}

class ContextManager {
  private context: SharedContext;
  private agents: Map<string, BuddyAgent>;
  
  // Context sharing methods
  async shareContext(fromAgent: string, toAgent: string, data: any): Promise<void>
  async updateGlobalContext(updates: Partial<SharedContext>): Promise<void>
  async getRelevantContext(agent: string, task: Task): Promise<any>
  
  // Security and privacy
  async validateContextAccess(agent: string, dataType: string): Promise<boolean>
  async encryptSensitiveData(data: any): Promise<any>
}
```

#### **Context Flow Patterns**

**Information Sharing Flow:**
1. **Agent Request** → Context Manager validates access
2. **Data Retrieval** → Relevant context filtered and provided
3. **Task Execution** → Agent processes with context
4. **Result Update** → Context updated with outcomes
5. **Knowledge Sharing** → Other agents notified of relevant updates

**Privacy & Security Controls:**
- **Data Classification**: Public, Internal, Confidential levels
- **Access Control**: Agent-specific permissions
- **Audit Logging**: All context access tracked
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
