# Buddy AI Best Practices Project

This project is dedicated to continuously improving Buddy AI by systematically gathering, processing, and synthesizing best practices related to AI agent development, with a specific focus on Gemini CLI.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to build a comprehensive best practices document that guides the enhancement of Buddy AI's performance and functionality. As Buddy AI is built on top of Gemini CLI, this document emphasizes optimal configuration and building strategies for Gemini AI.

## Process

The process for gathering and refining best practices involves the following steps:

0.  **Create Checklist:** Establish and maintain a checklist to track progress of processed resources.
1.  **Resource Gathering:** Collect a wide range of resources (documentation, videos, GitHub repositories, etc.) relevant to AI agent development and Gemini AI.
2.  **Document Processing:** For each resource, extract core insights and best practices using AI tools (like Fabric AI's `extract_wisdom` pattern), assess their relevance, and add them to the main best practices document.
3.  **Update Checklist:** Mark resources as processed in the checklist.
4.  **Review and Refine:** Periodically review and refine the accumulated best practices for clarity, conciseness, and alignment with project goals.

## Key Deliverables

*   **`The gole and the prompt.md`**: The main document containing the synthesized best practices for Buddy AI improvement.
*   **`checklist.md`**: A checklist to track the progress of processed resources.
*   **`polished_best_practices.md`**: A refined and consolidated version of the best practices.
