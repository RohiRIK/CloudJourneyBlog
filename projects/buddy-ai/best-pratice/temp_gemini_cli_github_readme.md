The `gemini-cli` is an open-source AI agent that integrates the power of Gemini directly into your terminal. Key features and capabilities include: Querying and editing large codebases. Generating new applications from PDFs or sketches using Gemini's multimodal capabilities. Automating operational tasks, such as querying pull requests or handling complex rebases. Connecting to tools and MCP servers for new capabilities, including media generation with Imagen, Veo, or Lyria. Grounding queries with the built-in Google Search tool. You can install the Gemini CLI using Node.js (version 20 or higher) via `npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli` or `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`. Alternatively, if you have Homebrew, you can install it with `brew install gemini-cli`. Common configuration steps involve picking a color theme and authenticating with your personal Google account. You can also use a Gemini API key or a Vertex AI API key for higher rate limits and more control over model usage.
