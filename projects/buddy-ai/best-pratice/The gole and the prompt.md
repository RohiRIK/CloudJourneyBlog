# Best Practices for Buddy AI Improvement

## Goal

The primary goal is to build a best practices document that will guide us in continuously improving Buddy AI. As Buddy AI is built on top of Gemini CLI, this document will specifically focus on best practices for configuring and building Gemini AI to achieve optimal performance and functionality.


## Process

To achieve this, we need to create a plan and workflow:

0.  **Create Checklist:** Establish a checklist to track progress and mark completed items. This checklist will be updated each time a resource is processed.

1.  **Resource Gathering:** Collect a wide range of resources, including documentation, YouTube videos, GitHub repositories, and more.

2.  **Document Processing:** For each document:
    *   Use the `extract_wisdom` pattern of the Fabric AI tool with Gemini models. This pattern is specifically designed to extract core insights and key takeaways, which will enable me to more effectively assess the relevance of the information. Refer to [[fabric-ai-workflows]] for details.
    *   I will then assess the extracted information for relevance to Buddy AI improvement.
    *   If I determine it's relevant, I will add it to this document.
    *   If not, I will proceed to the next resource.

3.  **Update Checklist:** After processing each resource, update the checklist to reflect the status (e.g., "processed," "relevant," "added to document").

4.  **Review and Refine:** Periodically review the accumulated best practices in this document, refine them for clarity and conciseness, and ensure they align with the overall goal.

## Outcome

Ultimately, we should have a well-polished document that we can use to continuously improve our project.

## Document and Checklist Location

Both this best practices document and the associated checklist will be maintained within the `projects/buddy-ai/best-pratice/` directory.

## Extracted Best Practices from Gemini CLI Overview

Based on the overview of Gemini CLI, here are some best practices and key considerations for building and improving AI agents like Buddy AI:
