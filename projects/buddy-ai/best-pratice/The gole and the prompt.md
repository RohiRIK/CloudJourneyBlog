# Best Practices for Buddy AI Improvement

## Goal

The primary goal is to build a best practices document that will guide us in continuously improving Buddy AI. As Buddy AI is built on top of Gemini CLI, this document will specifically focus on best practices for configuring and building Gemini AI to achieve optimal performance and functionality.


## Process

To achieve this, we need to create a plan and workflow:

0.  **Create Checklist:** Establish a checklist to track progress and mark completed items. This checklist will be updated each time a resource is processed.

1.  **Resource Gathering:** Collect a wide range of resources, including documentation, YouTube videos, GitHub repositories, and more.

2.  **Document Processing:** For each document:
    *   Use the `extract_wisdom` pattern of the Fabric AI tool with Gemini models. This pattern is specifically designed to extract core insights and key takeaways, which will enable me to more effectively assess the relevance of the information. Refer to [[fabric-ai-workflows]] for details.
    *   I will then assess the extracted information for relevance to Buddy AI improvement.
    *   If I determine it's relevant, I will add it to this document.
    *   If not, I will proceed to the next resource.

3.  **Update Checklist:** After processing each resource, update the checklist to reflect the status (e.g., "processed," "relevant," "added to document").

4.  **Review and Refine:** Periodically review the accumulated best practices in this document, refine them for clarity and conciseness, and ensure they align with the overall goal.

## Outcome

Ultimately, we should have a well-polished document that we can use to continuously improve our project.

## Document and Checklist Location

Both this best practices document and the associated checklist will be maintained within the `projects/buddy-ai/best-pratice/` directory.

## Extracted Best Practices from Gemini API Structured Output

Based on the Gemini API structured output documentation, here are best practices and key considerations for building and improving AI agents like Buddy AI, specifically focusing on generating structured output:

### Ideas for Building and Improving AI Agents (from Structured Output)

*   **Structured Output:** Configure Gemini for structured output (JSON or enum values) for precise information extraction and standardization.
*   **Schema Configuration (Recommended):** Use schema configuration on the model to constrain it to output JSON, rather than providing a schema in a text prompt.
*   **`responseSchema` Parameter:** Utilize the `responseSchema` parameter when configuring a schema.
*   **Pydantic Models for Python:** Leverage Python libraries like Pydantic to define schemas, which are automatically converted to JSON schemas.
*   **Enum Values:** Use enum values in the schema to constrain the model to choose a single option from a list.
*   **`Schema` Object and `propertyOrdering`:** Understand the `Schema` object and the importance of `propertyOrdering` for consistent and predictable output.
*   **JSON Schema Support (Preview):** Be aware of JSON Schema support as a preview feature with Gemini 2.5 and its limitations.
*   **Schema Size within Token Limit:** Keep the schema size within the input token limit.
*   **Optional Fields by Default:** Understand that fields are optional by default unless explicitly set as required.
*   **Context for Prompts:** Add more context to prompts if results are not as expected.
*   **Simplify Complex Schemas:** Resolve `InvalidArgument: 400` errors by simplifying complex schemas (e.g., shortening property names, flattening nested arrays, reducing constraints).

### Key Insights for AI-Powered CLI Development (from Structured Output)

*   Generating structured output from LLMs is crucial for precise information extraction and integration with other systems.
*   Configuring a schema directly on the model is the recommended and most reliable method for structured output.
*   Understanding schema limitations and best practices is essential for avoiding errors and optimizing output quality.
*   The ability to control output format enhances the utility of AI models for various applications.

### Habits for Effective CLI Development (from Structured Output)

*   Prioritize configuring schemas directly on the model for structured output.
*   Familiarize yourself with the `responseSchema` parameter and its usage.
*   Utilize Pydantic models in Python for defining and converting schemas.
*   Employ enum values to constrain model choices for specific fields.
*   Pay attention to `propertyOrdering` for consistent output.
*   Keep schemas concise and within input token limits.
*   Provide clear and sufficient context in prompts for better results.
*   Simplify complex schemas to prevent errors.

### Recommendations for Buddy AI Improvement (from Structured Output)

*   Implement structured output for Buddy AI's responses where precise information is required.
*   Prioritize schema configuration directly on the model for reliable structured output.
*   Leverage Python libraries that simplify schema definition and conversion.
*   Utilize enum values to guide Buddy AI's choices in specific contexts.
*   Ensure consistent property ordering in Buddy AI's structured responses.
*   Optimize schema size to stay within token limits for efficient processing.
*   Provide clear and concise context in prompts to Buddy AI for improved structured output.
*   Simplify complex output requirements to avoid errors and enhance Buddy AI's performance.
