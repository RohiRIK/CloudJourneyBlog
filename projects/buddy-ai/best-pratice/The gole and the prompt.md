# Best Practices for Buddy AI Improvement

## Goal

The goal is to build a best practices document that will guide us in improving Buddy AI.

## Process

I suggest creating a checklist that you can update each time you make progress.

To achieve this, we need to create a plan and workflow:

1.  **Resource Gathering:** Collect a wide range of resources, including documentation, YouTube videos, GitHub repositories, and more.

2.  **Document Processing:** For each document:
    *   Use the `extract_wisdom` pattern of the Fabric AI tool with Gemini models. Refer to [[fabric-ai-workflows]] for details.
    *   Decide if the extracted information is relevant.
    *   If relevant, add it to this document.
    *   If not, continue to the next resource.

## Outcome

Ultimately, we should have a well-polished document that we can use to continuously improve our project.
