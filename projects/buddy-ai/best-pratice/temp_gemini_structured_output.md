The content from the URL https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output is about "Structured output | Gemini API | Google AI for Developers". Key takeaways from the content: Gemini can be configured for structured output (JSON or enum values) instead of unstructured text for precise information extraction and standardization. There are two ways to generate JSON using the Gemini API: Configuring a schema on the model (recommended): This constrains the model to output JSON. Providing a schema in a text prompt: This method is not recommended as it might produce lower quality output and the model is not constrained to follow the schema. When configuring a schema, the `responseSchema` parameter is used. The Python library supports defining schemas using Pydantic models, which are automatically converted to JSON schemas. Enum values can be used in the schema to constrain the model to choose a single option from a list. The `Schema` object, which defines the structure of the JSON output, represents a subset of the OpenAPI 3.0 Schema object and includes a `propertyOrdering` field. `propertyOrdering` is important for consistent and predictable ordering of properties in the output. JSON Schema support is available as a preview using the `responseJsonSchema` field with Gemini 2.5, but it has limitations. Best practices include keeping the schema size within the input token limit, understanding that fields are optional by default unless set as required, and adding more context to prompts if results are not as expected. Complex schemas can lead to `InvalidArgument: 400` errors, which can be resolved by simplifying the schema (e.g., shortening property names, flattening nested arrays, reducing constraints).
