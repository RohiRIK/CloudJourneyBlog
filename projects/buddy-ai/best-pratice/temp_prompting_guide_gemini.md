The content from `https://www.promptingguide.ai/models/gemini` is about "Getting Started with Gemini" and provides an overview of the Gemini models and how to effectively prompt and use them. It covers capabilities, tips, applications, limitations, papers, and additional reading materials related to the Gemini models. Key points from the content include: Introduction to Gemini: Gemini is Google Deepmind's newest AI model, built with multimodal capabilities for crossmodal reasoning across texts, images, video, audio, and code. Gemini Sizes: It comes in three sizes: Ultra (most capable for complex tasks), Pro (best for scaling across a wide range of tasks), and Nano (efficient for on-device memory-constrained tasks, with 1.8B and 3.25B parameters). Performance: Gemini advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 benchmarks, including language, coding, reasoning, and multimodal reasoning. It's the first model to achieve human-expert performance on MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) and claims state of the art in 20 multimodal benchmarks. Context Length: The models are trained to support a 32k context length and are built on Transformer decoders with efficient attention mechanisms. Multimodal Capabilities: Gemini is trained natively multimodal, combining capabilities across modalities with the reasoning of a language model. This includes information extraction from tables, charts, and figures, discerning fine-grained details, aggregating context across space and time, and combining information across different modalities. Examples of Use Cases: The guide provides examples of text summarization, information extraction, visual question answering, verifying and correcting, rearranging figures, video understanding, image understanding, and modality combination. Coding Agent: Gemini is used to build AlphaCode 2, a generalist agent that combines reasoning with search and tool-use to solve competitive programming problems. Few-shot Prompting: The guide explains how to use few-shot prompting with Gemini models, which is useful for indicating the desired output format or style. Library Usage: It includes a simple Python example demonstrating how to prompt the Gemini Pro model using the `google-generativeai` library and API.
