Learn how to create an AI agent for trip planning using Gemini 1.5 Pro. This involves connecting the agent to external data sources like event APIs to generate personalized travel itineraries based on real-time information. Key concepts for building such an agent include: Function calling: This allows Gemini models (excluding Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision) to connect with external systems, APIs, and data sources, enabling the AI to retrieve real-time information and perform actions. Grounding: This enhances Gemini's ability to access and process information from external sources like documents, knowledge bases, and the web, leading to more accurate and up-to-date responses. By combining these features, an AI agent can understand user requests, retrieve relevant information from the web, and provide personalized recommendations. The article provides a step-by-step guide for function calling with grounding, using a scenario where an AI engineer creates an agent to help users plan trips by finding local events and hotels. This involves defining potential user queries, setting up the development environment (Jupyter notebook with Vertex AI SDK for Python), configuring API keys (e.g., SerpAPI for events and hotels), defining custom functions for the APIs, declaring these functions as tools for Gemini, and building and testing the agent.
