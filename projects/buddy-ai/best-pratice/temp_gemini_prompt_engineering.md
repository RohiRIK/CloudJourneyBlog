The article "Best Practices For Prompt Engineering With Gemini 2.5 Pro" discusses the art and science of defining and optimizing prompts to guide AI models for desired responses, increased accuracy, and reduced token usage and cost. Key best practices for prompt engineering include: Combining Several Prompting Techniques: This involves using different approaches like Zero-Shot Prompting (e.g., "Provide strategies for DDoS Prevention at Linux."), One-Shot Prompting (e.g., "Provide step by step strategies for DDoS Prevention with Nginx at Linux."), and using Personas (e.g., "You are a highly experienced Cyber Security. Explain the concept of DDoS Prevention to a beginner."). Defining the Role and Expertise: Clearly specify the AI's role, such as "You are a Cyber Security Architect Expert who specializes in providing strategies to protect a website from malicious attacks". Providing Guidance Instead of Giving Orders: Guide the AI rather than simply commanding it. Specifying the Task and Clear Goals: Clearly define what the AI needs to do. Giving Concise and Clear Explanations: Ensure instructions are easy to understand. For AI model parameters, the article suggests: Defining the Temperature: For reasoning tasks, set the temperature to a lower value (e.g., 0.2), while for creative purposes, a higher temperature (e.g., 1.5 to 2) is recommended. Being Wise with Output Length: Adjust the output length to be neither too short nor too long, as shorter lengths can lead to faster performance and cost savings. Leaving Other Settings as Default: Unless necessary, keep other AI model settings at their default values. The article concludes that implementing these best practices and leveraging advanced prompt techniques like ReAct (Reason + Act) can improve accuracy and quality, and reduce token usage and cost when working with Large Language Models (LLMs).
