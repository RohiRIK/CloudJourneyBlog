# Azure Logic Apps

This directory contains Azure Logic App templates for automating various security and compliance tasks within Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). Each solution is designed to enhance security posture, improve operational efficiency, and ensure compliance with organizational policies.

## üìã Solution Overview

Each subdirectory represents a complete Azure Logic App automation solution, containing its definition, configuration, documentation, and deployment resources.

### Available Solutions

- **[Security Info Registration Alert](./security-info-registration-alert/)**: Monitors and alerts on security information registration changes in Microsoft Entra ID.
- **[Break Glass Automation](./break-glass-automation/)**: Automates the management of emergency access accounts within Conditional Access policies.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Each solution includes:
- **Complete Logic App definition** (`logic_app.json`)
- **Configuration templates** (`config/`)
- **Comprehensive documentation** (`docs/`)
- **Email templates** (`templates/`)
- **Utility scripts** (`util/`)

## üîß Common Prerequisites

All Logic Apps in this collection require:

### Azure Environment
- Azure subscription with Logic Apps enabled
- Microsoft Entra ID Premium licensing (for advanced features)
- Appropriate Azure RBAC permissions

### Security Requirements
- Managed identity configuration for Logic Apps
- Microsoft Graph API permissions
- Secure credential management

### Operational Requirements
- Log Analytics workspace (for monitoring solutions)
- Email service integration (Office 365 or Exchange Online)
- Change management processes

## üìñ Implementation Guide

### 1. Choose Your Solution
Select the Logic App that meets your organizational needs:
- **Security Monitoring**: Use Security Info Registration Alert
- **Emergency Access**: Use Break Glass Automation

### 2. Review Prerequisites
Each solution has specific requirements documented in its respective README.

### 3. Deploy and Configure
Follow the step-by-step deployment guides in each solution's documentation.

### 4. Monitor and Maintain
Implement ongoing monitoring and maintenance procedures.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Authentication
- Use managed identities wherever possible
- Implement least privilege access principles
- Regularly review and rotate credentials

### Monitoring
- Enable comprehensive logging for all Logic Apps
- Set up alerts for execution failures
- Monitor for unusual access patterns

### Change Management
- Test all changes in non-production environments
- Document all modifications
- Implement approval workflows for critical changes

## üìä Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Logic App execution success rates
- API call latency and throttling
- Error rates and failure patterns
- Resource consumption and costs

### Recommended Alerts
- Logic App execution failures
- Authentication errors
- API quota exhaustion
- Unexpected high volume of executions

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication Failures**: Check managed identity permissions
2. **API Throttling**: Review call patterns and implement retry logic
3. **Email Delivery Issues**: Verify email service configuration
4. **Log Analytics Queries**: Validate workspace access and query syntax

### Diagnostic Resources
- Logic App run history provides detailed execution information
- Azure Monitor logs contain comprehensive diagnostic data
- Microsoft Graph API documentation for permission requirements
