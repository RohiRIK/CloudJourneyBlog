# Break Glass Automation Logic App

## Overview
This Logic App automates the management of emergency access accounts (break glass accounts) within Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access policies. It ensures that emergency access accounts are properly excluded from Conditional Access policies to maintain access during emergencies while providing audit trails and monitoring capabilities.

## Key Features
- Automatically excludes break glass accounts from Conditional Access policies
- Monitors and logs all emergency access account activities
- Provides comprehensive error handling and notifications
- Maintains audit trails for compliance requirements
- Supports multiple emergency access accounts
- Includes rollback capabilities for policy changes

## Business Value
- **Emergency Preparedness**: Ensures administrative access during system outages or misconfigurations
- **Compliance**: Maintains proper audit trails and documentation for regulatory requirements
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces risk of complete administrative lockout
- **Automation**: Eliminates manual intervention for emergency access management

## Components

### 1. Core Logic App (`logic_app.json`)
The main workflow that:
- Retrieves all Conditional Access policies
- Identifies break glass accounts that should be excluded
- Updates policies to include proper exclusions
- Logs all changes for audit purposes

### 2. Configuration (`config/`)
Contains configuration files for:
- Break glass account identifiers
- Policy exclusion rules
- Notification settings
- Logging configurations

### 3. Documentation (`docs/`)
Comprehensive documentation including:
- Implementation guides
- Best practices for break glass account management
- Troubleshooting procedures
- Security considerations

### 4. Templates (`templates/`)
Ready-to-use templates for:
- Email notifications
- Audit reports
- Policy documentation
- Deployment scripts

### 5. Utilities (`util/`)
Helper scripts for:
- Managed identity permission assignment
- Initial setup and configuration
- Testing and validation

## Prerequisites

### Azure Requirements
1. Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
2. Microsoft Entra ID Premium licensing
3. Conditional Access policy management permissions
4. Logic Apps service availability

### Permission Requirements
- **Conditional Access Policies**: Read and Write access
- **Microsoft Graph API**: Application permissions for Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess
- **Audit Logs**: Read access for compliance monitoring

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Break Glass Accounts
1. Create dedicated emergency access accounts
2. Configure accounts with appropriate permissions
3. Document account details and access procedures
4. Test accounts regularly to ensure functionality

### Step 2: Deploy the Logic App
1. Import the `logic_app.json` template
2. Configure managed identity for the Logic App
3. Assign required Microsoft Graph permissions
4. Update configuration with your break glass account details

### Step 3: Configure Policies
1. Review existing Conditional Access policies
2. Identify policies that should exclude break glass accounts
3. Test the automation in a non-production environment
4. Deploy to production with monitoring

### Step 4: Set Up Monitoring
1. Configure audit logging for policy changes
2. Set up alerts for break glass account usage
3. Implement regular review processes
4. Document emergency procedures

## Security Considerations

### Break Glass Account Security
- Use strong, unique passwords that are securely stored
- Implement multi-factor authentication where possible
- Regularly rotate credentials
- Monitor account usage continuously

### Automation Security
- Use managed identities for authentication
- Apply principle of least privilege for permissions
- Implement approval workflows for critical changes
- Maintain comprehensive audit trails

### Policy Management
- Test all changes in non-production environments
- Implement rollback procedures
- Document all policy modifications
- Regular review of exclusion rules

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review break glass account access logs
- Validate Conditional Access policy exclusions
- Test emergency access procedures
- Update documentation as needed

### Alerts and Notifications
- Break glass account sign-in activities
- Conditional Access policy modifications
- Logic App execution failures
- Unusual access patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Errors**: Verify managed identity has required Graph API permissions
2. **Policy Update Failures**: Check Conditional Access policy configurations
3. **Account Detection Issues**: Validate break glass account identifiers
4. **Logic App Failures**: Review execution history and error logs

### Diagnostic Steps
1. Check Logic App run history for detailed error information
2. Verify Microsoft Graph API connectivity and permissions
3. Validate break glass account configuration
4. Review Conditional Access policy settings

## Best Practices

### Break Glass Account Management
- Maintain at least two break glass accounts
- Use cloud-only accounts (not synchronized from on-premises)
- Exclude from password policies and MFA requirements
- Store credentials in secure, offline locations

### Automation Best Practices
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Use descriptive names for Logic App components
- Test thoroughly before production deployment
- Document all configuration changes

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly: Review break glass account usage and access logs
- Quarterly: Test emergency access procedures
- Annually: Review and update security configurations

### Documentation Updates
- Keep emergency procedures current
- Update contact information regularly
- Document any configuration changes
- Maintain change logs for audit purposes
