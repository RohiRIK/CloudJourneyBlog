This post outlines my approach to onboarding Active Directory (AD) devices to **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**. As an integrator, my focus is on simplifying the process of integrating security solutions, ensuring organizations can efficiently secure their endpoints while minimizing complexity.

**Section 1: Introduction**

Endpoint security is a top concern for organizations today, especially as cyber threats continue to evolve. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides an advanced layer of protection, detecting, investigating, and responding to potential security risks. The integration of **Microsoft Entra ID**, **Intune**, and **Defender for Endpoint** allows organizations to manage their AD-joined devices seamlessly while enhancing security.

**Section 2: Key Considerations Before You Start**

Before diving into the integration process, ensure that the following pieces are in place:

- You’ll need an **active Microsoft Defender for Endpoint subscription**.
- A solid understanding of **Microsoft Entra Connect** to sync devices and users.
- **Intune** set up as your Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution.
- Administrative access to configure the necessary services.

These prerequisites create a strong foundation for a smooth implementation.

**Section 3: Joining Devices to the Cloud**

To manage AD-joined devices efficiently, they need to be joined to **Microsoft Entra ID** and **Intune** as hybrid devices. This integration ensures that devices are registered in the cloud and ready for policy management.

If you don’t already have **Microsoft Entra Connect** installed and configured, you’ll need to set it up before proceeding with the device joining process. This step involves synchronizing your on-premises Active Directory with **Microsoft Entra ID**. I will cover this process in a separate blog post for further details.

Once **Entra Connect** is in place, the process becomes automated. Devices will automatically register with **Microsoft Entra ID** and **Intune** upon user login. By automating this step, organizations reduce the complexity of manual enrollment.

**Section 4: Onboarding to Defender for Endpoint**

Once devices are enrolled in **Microsoft Entra ID and Intune**, the next step is to onboard them to **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**. This allows the organization to start collecting security data and applying protection policies.

The onboarding process should be seamless. By connecting **Intune** to **Defender for Endpoint**, devices are automatically onboarded without manual intervention, ensuring that security is applied as soon as possible.

**Section 5: Clean Slate with Old EDR Solutions**

Before implementing a new EDR solution, it’s essential to remove any old ones to avoid conflicts. As part of the integration process, I always recommend removing previous solutions to ensure that **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** operates without interference.

A centralized, automated removal process through **Intune** or a PowerShell script can simplify this task and save time.

**Section 6: Fine-Tuning Defender for Endpoint through Intune**

Once the devices are onboarded, it’s essential to configure **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** through **Intune** to ensure comprehensive security. This involves customizing security policies and enforcing settings tailored to your organization’s needs.

In addition to the basic configurations, **Microsoft’s security baselines** provide a comprehensive set of policies designed by Microsoft experts to secure endpoints. These baselines contain over 300 built-in rules that can be easily applied. If these baselines are effective for Microsoft, they are certainly a solid choice for securing your devices as well.

Key configurations include:

- **BitLocker Policies**: These policies encrypt all device drives to protect sensitive data. We also ensure that the encryption keys are securely stored in **device input objects**, ensuring data remains safe even if the device is lost or compromised.
- **Windows Update Policies**: Implementing strict update policies ensures devices are always up-to-date with the latest security patches. Keeping devices patched reduces vulnerabilities and strengthens defenses against known threats.
- **Secure Browser Policies**: Secure browser configurations help mitigate web-based threats like phishing and malware. By enforcing these policies, organizations can minimize risks related to online activities.
- **Compliance Policies**: Compliance policies define the acceptable security posture for devices. By evaluating devices against these policies, we ensure they meet the organization’s security standards. Devices that don’t comply with the set requirements can be blocked from accessing corporate resources until the issue is resolved, ensuring that only secure devices are granted access.

Leveraging Microsoft’s security baselines and compliance policies, along with other configuration options, ensures that devices remain secure, compliant, and protected against evolving threats.

**Conclusion**

The goal is to simplify the process of securing Active Directory devices while ensuring robust protection against threats. By integrating **Microsoft Entra ID**, **Intune**, and **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**, organizations can streamline their security operations and ensure that all devices are managed centrally. The process is automated and efficient, minimizing the need for manual intervention while maximizing security.

By following these steps, organizations can stay ahead of emerging threats and maintain a strong security posture without overcomplicating their workflows.
