My journey into tech was non-traditional. I thrive on the feeling of building something tangible and watching it work, a passion that led me from a career in fitness to the world of cloud and cybersecurity. This repository is where I channel that passion, documenting my work in securing cloud environments and automating everything I can.

Here you will find battle-tested solutions, comprehensive guides, and production-ready automation for modern IT environments.
