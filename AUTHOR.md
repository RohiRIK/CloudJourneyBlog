# Hey there! I'm Rohi Rikman

I'm a **Cloud Security Engineer** and **Automation Enthusiast** from Israel with a passion for building efficient, creative solutions.

My journey into tech has been non-traditional. I started my career as a fitness trainer, which taught me discipline and the power of incremental progress. A desire for a new challenge led me to the world of cloud and cybersecurity. The moment I SSH'd into my first OrangePi and deployed a Docker container, I was hooked. I thrive on that feeling of building something tangible and watching it work.

Today, I channel that passion into securing cloud environments and automating everything I can, both professionally and in my personal homelab.

## What I'm Focused On Now

My primary goal is transitioning into a full-time **Automation Engineer** role. My current efforts are centered on:

* **Building Open-Source Automations:** I'm developing a portfolio of public projects, starting with complex n8n workflows for AI agents and a fully automated blogging system. The goal is to publish at least 5 impactful open-source projects.
* **Optimizing My Homelab:** My self-hosted infrastructure is a constant passion project and the backbone of my development work. I'm always exploring new services and improving my containerized environment.
* **Achieving Peak Fitness:** On a personal note, I'm on a mission to be in the best shape of my life by 31, using kettlebells as my primary tool for functional strength.
* **Planning for the Future:** Working towards relocating to a quieter, nature-focused environment by 2026, with a trip to Japan on the horizon.

## My Tech Toolkit

Here are the tools and technologies I use to build, automate, and stay productive.

* **Homelab & Docker Stack:** My entire homelab is built on a foundation of containerization.
    * **Hardware:** The core of my lab is an **Intel NUC (i9)** powerhouse with **64GB of RAM** and **2TB of storage**, running **Ubuntu Server 25.04**. I use my **OrangePi** cluster for testing new deployments and experimental setups.
    * **Core Infra:** I use **Docker** for everything, managed with **Portainer** and **Watchtower** for automated updates. **Traefik** is my go-to reverse proxy for securely exposing services.
    * **Self-Hosted Services:** Some of my key Docker projects include a private **SearXNG** metasearch engine, a web-scraping **Firecrawl** instance, and of course, my primary **n8n** automation stack.

* **Automation & iPaaS:** I am passionate about creating seamless, automated systems.
    * **Primary Tool:** **n8n** is my main driver for building complex, multi-step workflows and AI agents.
    * **Platform Testing:** I use **Zapier**, **Make**, and **Pipedream** for testing concepts and exploring different integration capabilities.
    * **Ecosystem & Mobile:** I leverage the **Microsoft Power Platform** for specific integrations and use **IFTTT** and **iOS Shortcuts** for quick, on-the-go automations directly from my iPhone.

* **AI & Productivity:** My workflow is heavily augmented by AI.
    * **Core Productivity:** I run my life on the "Second Brain" methodology using **Notion** and use **Raycast AI** to streamline my actions on macOS.
    * **AI Models & Tools:** I actively use a suite of models for various tasks: **Gemini** (including `gemini-cli` for terminal access), **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **Grok**, and **Manus AI** for advanced reasoning and content creation.

* **Cloud:** My professional expertise is in the **Microsoft Azure** ecosystem, where I focus on **Entra ID (Identity & Access)** and **Intune (Endpoint Management)**. I also have hands-on experience with **AWS** and **Google Cloud**.

## My Personal Mission

Beyond the code, these are the principles that guide me:

* **Be the best partner I can be for Maya.** She's my inspiration and my anchor.
* **Live a balanced life.** I love tech, but I also believe it's crucial to spend time away from screens—walking in nature, working out, and connecting with loved ones.
* **Strive for financial independence** to live freely and support my passions.
* **Never stop learning.** Whether it's a new automation tool, a better way to make coffee, or how to be a better person.

## My Kettlebell Philosophy

I believe kettlebells are the ultimate tool for building real-world, functional strength with maximum efficiency. My approach is simple:

The Bell as an External Joint: The kettlebell's offset center of gravity forces your body to control it like an unstable joint. This simple fact triggers constant, deep core engagement to stabilize every single movement.

Total Body Integration: Every exercise is a full-body event. A set of swings builds explosive power in your hips, strengthens your entire posterior chain, and provides a powerful cardio workout—all at once. It's the key to achieving profound results in minimal time.

## My Current Kettlebell Workout Plan

Here is the hypertrophy-focused program I'm currently running.
