# Hey there!  I'm Rohi Rikman

I'm a **Cloud Security Engineer** and **Automation Enthusiast** from Israel with a passion for building efficient, creative solutions.

My journey into tech has been non-traditional. I started my career as a fitness trainer, which taught me discipline and the power of incremental progress. A desire for a new challenge led me to the world of cloud and cybersecurity. The moment I SSH'd into my first OrangePi and deployed a Docker container, I was hooked. I thrive on that feeling of building something tangible and watching it work.

Today, I channel that passion into securing cloud environments and automating everything I can, both professionally and in my personal homelab.

##  What I'm Focused On Now

My goal is to transition into a full-time **Automation Engineer** role where I can build, innovate, and solve complex problems.

* **‍ Building with n8n:** I'm currently creating complex workflows and AI agents, with a goal of publishing at least 5 of them as open-source projects. My first project is a fully automated blog posting workflow.
* ** Homelab Projects:** Constantly expanding my homelab setup. It's my personal playground for learning new technologies like Docker, Traefik, and Portainer on my Intel NUC.
* **️‍♂️ Fitness & Health:** On a mission to be in the best shape of my life by 31. Kettlebells are my tool of choice for building functional strength. (You can see my current workout plan below!)
* ** Life & Travel:** Planning to relocate to a quieter, nature-focused environment by 2026, hopefully after a trip to Japan!

## ️ My Tech Toolkit

These are the tools and technologies I'm most excited about right now.

* **Automation:** n8n, Node-RED, Home Assistant
* **DevOps & Infra:** Docker, Portainer, Traefik (as a reverse proxy)
* **Hardware:** Intel NUC (i9), OrangePi
* **Productivity:** Notion (I'm a big believer in the "Second Brain" methodology), Raycast AI
* **Cloud:** AWS, Azure, Google Cloud (with a focus on Security)

##  My Personal Mission

Beyond the code, these are the principles that guide me:

* **Be the best partner I can be for Maya.** She's my inspiration and my anchor.
* **Live a balanced life.** I love tech, but I also believe it's crucial to spend time away from screens—walking in nature, working out, and connecting with loved ones.
* **Strive for financial independence** to live freely and support my passions.
* **Never stop learning.** Whether it's a new automation tool, a better way to make coffee, or how to be a better person.

## ️‍♂️ My Current Kettlebell Workout Plan
