# SearXNG Docker Configuration
# This file contains environment variables for configuring SearXNG with Docker

# By default listen on https://localhost
# To change this:
# * uncomment SEARXNG_HOSTNAME, and replace <host> by the SearXNG hostname
# * uncomment LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL, and replace <email> by your email (require to create a Let's Encrypt certificate)

# SearXNG hostname - uncomment and set your domain
# SEARXNG_HOSTNAME=searxng.your-domain.com
# Let's Encrypt email for SSL certificate - uncomment and set your email
# LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=your-email@example.com

# Optional Performance Settings:
# If you run a very small or a very large instance, you might want to change the amount of used uwsgi workers and threads per worker
# More workers (= processes) means that more search requests can be handled at the same time, but it also causes more resource usage

# Number of uWSGI worker processes (default: 4)
# SEARXNG_UWSGI_WORKERS=4
# Number of threads per worker (default: 4)
# SEARXNG_UWSGI_THREADS=4

# Traefik Configuration
# Domain for Traefik reverse proxy
TRAEFIK_DOMAIN=your-domain.com

# Additional Configuration Options:
# Uncomment and modify as needed

# Custom SearXNG settings file path
# SEARXNG_SETTINGS_PATH=/usr/local/searxng/settings.yml

# SearXNG secret key for session management
# SEARXNG_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here

# Enable/disable SearXNG features
# SEARXNG_AUTOCOMPLETE=true
# SEARXNG_DEFAULT_THEME=simple
